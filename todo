all env plots improvements:
    return ration
    make lines slightly more thiker
    add opt-ail-sa
    should i add ci? 

all clipping values plots
    font is too small    

plto justification of why only 4 nn. It needs to be easy to see that with multiple neural network it doesn't make a lot of a difference. 
    * more compelx env to see some difference
    * different clipping values? No, we need to highlight that more NN doens't imply improvement. How do you choose the clipping? 5 seems good enough for all. 
    * which algoriothm? only one, ML-IRL? 
    * for all environemtns 1 3 4 5 10


plot clipping is necessary, there are probably more run than necessary.
