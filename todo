all env plots improvements:
    return ration
    make lines slightly more thiker
    add opt-ail-sa
    should i add ci? 

all clipping values plots
    font is too small    

plto justification of why only 4 nn. It needs to be easy to see that with multiple neural network it doesn't make a lot of a difference. 
    * more compelx env to see some difference
    * different clipping values? No, we need to highlight that more NN doens't imply improvement. How do you choose the clipping? 5 seems good enough for all. 
    * which algoriothm? only one, ML-IRL? 
    * for all environemtns 1 3 4 5 10


plot clipping is necessary, there are probably more run than necessary.

commento sui plot grid search che il clipping non funziona (trajectories)

grid search meno granulare su hopper walker 




what do we want to show? that different number of neural networks don't lead to big differences in results
